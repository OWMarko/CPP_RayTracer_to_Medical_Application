# C++ Path Tracer

## The Project
This is a Path Tracer written entirely in C++17 built from the ground up. I started this project using Peter Shirley's *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* as a foundation, but my goal goes beyond just making pretty images. I designed the architecture to evolve into a Self Made Scientific Visualization Tool for medical imaging data.

I wanted to bridge the gap between the math theory I learned in university and low-level implementation.

## Motivation & Learning Goals
Coming from a background where we heavily used Python, I wanted to challenge myself with C++ to understand what happens "under the hood".

* **Transition from Python to C++ : ** Instead of relying on high-level libraries, I’m implementing the core logic in C++
* **Mathematical Modeling :** Implemented vector calculus, linear algebra, and geometric intersections from the ground up
* **Monte Carlo & Markov Chains :** I’ve studied Monte Carlo integration and Markov Chains in theory; this project is my way of applying those stochastic processes to a concrete rendering problem, rather than just calling a function in a Python script
  
## Features
The engine is currently a pure C++ implementation with no external graphics dependencies.
* **Primitives :** Mathematical sphere intersections
* **Materials :** Implemented Lambertian (Matte), Metal (Reflective), and Dielectric (Glass with Schlick approximation)
* **Camera :** Positionable camera with simulated Defocus Blur (Depth of Field)
* **Quality :** MSAA (Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing) and Gamma Correction

## Roadmap: The Pivot to Medical
This repository logs my progression from standard surface rendering to volumetric simulation.

- [x] **Phase 1: The Foundation** (Current)
    - Getting the Monte Carlo Ray Tracer running
    - Setting up a clean OOP architecture (Materials, Hittables, Camera)
    
- [ ] **Phase 2: Performance Engineering**
    - The current complexity is $O(N)$. I plan to implement BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchies) to drop this to $O(\log N)$
    - Parallelizing the render loop using **OpenMP**
    - Profiling and benchmarking the gains

- [ ] **Phase 3: Medical Application (The Goal)**
    - Transitioning from rendering spheres to **Volumetric Ray Casting**
    - Reading and visualizing raw 3D Scalar Fields (CT Scans / MRI Data)
    - Using SIMD Vectorization to process voxels efficiently
